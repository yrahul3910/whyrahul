                    I work at the intersection of artificial intelligence and software engineering. My
                    work includes a novel SOTA hyper-parameter optimization method that requires 25% of
                    the runtime and a novel oversampling method that improves defect prediction by up to
                    123%. My dissertation focused on better, faster deep learning for SE by using feedforward
                    networks over static code features with theoretically-driven novel methods that outperform
                    the prior state-of-the-art at a fraction of the cost.

                    I work on theoretical and applied deep learning, especially with loss functions.
                    A lot of my applied deep learning work involves using recent results from the
                    theoretical literature, bridging the gap between the two. Examples of this can
                    be seen in my work on automated microservice partitioning and hyper-parameter
                    optimization. Many of my core insights come from optimizing for better properties
                    of the loss.
