            I am a coffee enthusiast. Currently, I brew my pour overs using the Orea v3, and my espresso using
            the Breville Barista Express and a Sette 270Wi. My favorite coffee so far was a Panama Geisha from
            Black &amp; White Coffee Roasters.

            I&apos;ve been a big fan of Taylor Swift since 2018! My favorite era is the Lover era, although I currently have
            evermore on repeat. My current favorite songs (in no particular order) are <i>Hits Different,</i>
            <i>Cruel Summer (Live),</i> <i>Nothing New (Taylor&apos; Version) (From The Vault),</i>
            <i>I Can See You (Taylor&apos; Version) (From The Vault),</i> <i>You&apos;re On Your Own, Kid,</i>
            and <i>gold rush,</i> although this list frequently changes. Yes, I&apos;m excited for TTPD!
