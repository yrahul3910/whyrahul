            I am a coffee enthusiast. Currently, I brew my pour overs using the Orea v3, and my espresso using
            the Breville Barista Express and a Sette 270Wi. My favorite coffee so far was a Panama Geisha from
            Black &amp; White Coffee Roasters.

            I&apos;ve been a big fan of Taylor Swift since 2018! My favorite era is the Lover era, although I currently have
            evermore on repeat. My current favorite songs (in no particular order) are <i>Hits Different,</i>
            <i>Cruel Summer (Live),</i> <i>Nothing New (Taylor&apos; Version) (From The Vault),</i>
            <i>I Can See You (Taylor&apos; Version) (From The Vault),</i> <i>You&apos;re On Your Own, Kid,</i>
            <i>gold rush,</i> although this list frequently changes. Yes, I&apos;m excited for TTPD!

        <p>
            As fragmented as the smart home market can be, I am slowly getting deeper into it in the HomeKit ecosystem.
            My current favorite use of the smart home is to remotely turn on my espresso machine using the SwitchBot Bot
            to let it heat up before use.
